billrive-service
Spring RESTful WebService powered by MySQL using JPA with Hibernate as the provider.
To setup your Tomcat environment, replace your conf/server.xml and conf/context.xml with their equivalents in this repository (conf/tomcat folder). Use the conf/billrive.sql to populate your MySQL database. Match the connection details with that of those in conf/context.xml

Debugging in Tomcat:
Starting Tomcat in Debug mode from Netbeans doesn't work.
Do a "catalina jpda start" in the /bin folder externally and connect to port 8000 for debugging from Netbeans/Eclipse.
From Netbeans: Go to server properties and setup the right debugging option and the port number. Use the same port number to debug.

Permgen Error:
Add the following VM options to resolve the error (can be added as startup env args in Netbeans)
-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:PermSize=128m
