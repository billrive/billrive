What you Need:
Git for Windows or Linux (git-scm.org) or Netbeans with GIT plugin installed
Netbeans or Eclipse 
Tomcat 7
Netbeans chrome integration plugin (optional but preferred if you'd like to use Netbeans)
Angular Batarang plugin for Chrome (optional)

To get a copy of the code, Clone the GIT repository using Netbeans GIT plugin or through the native windows GIT plugin.

git clone https://github.com/billrive/billrive.git

Billrive Development Setup Guide
Introduction:
Billrive is comprised of two applications (for now)
billrive-service (Spring MVC, REST, JPA (Hibernate as provider), MySQL DB)
billrive-client (Angular JS, Bootstrap, Underscore)

Initial Setup:
-	Recommended Tools for development: (The project is IDE neutral but this setup is tested and works best)
-	Netbeans, MySQL Community Cluster, MySQL Workbench, JBOSS 6/7, Netbeans Chrome plugin,  Chrome Angular Batarang plugin. (Recent versions unless specified otherwise)
-	Clone the repository to your computer. 
-	git clone http://github.com/billrive/billrive.git

Setting up billrive-client:
-	The billrive-client project is a Netbeans HTML5 project. So Netbeans identified the project and you can open it in Netbeans that way (File -> Open -> point to the downloaded billrive-client folder).
-	Make sure that you have Netbeans Chrome plugin installed. Restart both Chrome and Netbeans.
-	Now expand the billrive-client project -> app . Right click and hit "run". It should open it and show the client view in Chrome. If it doesn't, Right click on the project -> properties -> Run. In "Browser" drop down, select "Netbeans with Chrome Integration"
-	Now retry running the index.html in the app folder.
-	This setup enables setting up breakpoints for debugging javascript (Angular).
Setting up Application Server and the Database:
-	The conf folder from the repository has all the configuration files needed for this project.
-	Tomcat: 
To setup your Tomcat environment, replace your conf/server.xml and conf/context.xml with their equivalents in this repository (conf/tomcat folder). Use the conf/billrive.sql to populate your MySQL database. Match the connection details with that of those in conf/context.xml

Debugging in Tomcat:
Starting Tomcat in Debug mode from Netbeans doesn't work.
Do a "catalina jpda start" in the /bin folder externally and connect to port 8000 for debugging from Netbeans/Eclipse.
From Netbeans: Go to server properties and setup the right debugging option and the port number. Use the same port number to debug.

Permgen Error:
Add the following VM options to resolve the error (can be added as startup env args in Netbeans)
-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:PermSize=128m



-	Download mysql jdbc driver jar and paste it in the lib folder.
-	MySQL: Download MySQL. Start the server. Download MySQL Workbench. Open up MySql Workbench and create a connection to your localhost MySQL instance. Create a database titled 'billrivedb'.
-	Use the conf/billrive.sql to populate the database.


Setting up billrive-service:
-	billrive-service is a maven project. You can open the project in Netbeans or import it into Eclipse.
-	Install Maven, JDK 6/7 on your computer and run mvn install or package and deploy the application to the application server. The following REST url should output some sample JSON for the  bills object.
o	http://localhost:8080/billrive-service/rest/1/bills/


Architecture
BillRive-Service
-	Spring MVC (REST) architecture. REST architecture following the guidelines from this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXYw4J4QOU).




billrive-service
Spring RESTful WebService powered by MySQL using JPA with Hibernate as the provider.
To setup your Tomcat environment, replace your conf/server.xml and conf/context.xml with their equivalents in this repository (conf/tomcat folder). Use the conf/billrive.sql to populate your MySQL database. Match the connection details with that of those in conf/context.xml

Add the following VM options to resolve the error (can be added as startup env args in Netbeans)
-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:PermSize=128m

JRebel:
-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:PermSize=128m -javaagent:c:/dev/jrebel/jrebel.jar -Drebel.remoting_plugin=true

billrive-client
Currently a Angular JS Seeded project.
