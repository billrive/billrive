                        Hello Everyone!

                        <ul>
                            <li>The goal of this presentation is to provide an introduction to Angular JS, 
                                Build a nice TODO app to explore Angular's features</li>
                            <li> and find out what Angular JS has got to offer.</li>
                        </ul>

                        I've begun preparing for this presentation and writing slides a month ago. I opened the slides yesterday and they were just like when I first started.

                        So seems like giving a presentation is kinda like getting married. You can never be prepared. You just have to do it.

                                <li>First we'll look at the reasons for why a framework such as Angular JS has come into existence. We'll look at the problems that it is trying to address and how it solves them.

                                    We will explore various concepts of Angular including Two-way data binding, Scope, Directives, Filters, MVC etc.
                                    Then we'll dive into some examples and take a closer look at how Angular works. 

                                <li>We'll also explore various options available for debugging, packaging, dependency management and deployment.


                                <li>I'll also present some best practices (if time permits).
                                </li>

                            <li>HTML was originally designed to show static documents on the web.</li>
                            <li>But we want Desktop style apps. We get then by either

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript (GWT, Vaadin etc)</li>
                                    <li>Manipulating the DOM (JQuery)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <ul> <li>The web has enabled businesses to connect to its users with just a browser. And as we all know browsers can only understand HTML, CSS and Javascript.


                                </li>
                                <li>    But HTML was never meant to support development of interactive Desktop style apps like we do now. It was originally developed for displaying static content/documents. The HTML spec we still use today (version 4.0)was drafted in 1999. Now  we are focusing on HTML 5 but there's still a lot that's not in there to help us in this regard.

                                </li>

                                    So we use certain frameworks to deal with HTML’s shortcomings by either abstracting away from HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript ( using GWT, Vaadin etc) or by manipulating the DOM (JQuery is a prime example for that).</li>

                          Those of you who  have worked with Flex or WPF may be already familiar with Data Binding.It is very simple. You have a model (data) specific to your application and you bind this model to a template and let the templating engine generate the views for you.

                                 <li>  Here I have a very simple model with a profile of Tony Stark and it's bound to two templates and generated two views. Now the interesting part about this is that this is not a one time link between the view and the model. It is a live system where if I modify the model, the templating engine will observe this change and will update the view automatically. I don't need to go update the view everytime the model changes. And it also works the other way around. So if you have two way data binding and you bind the model to the form like I have in the second view. If the user starts interacting with the form and starts changing the form content, the changes will be propagated automatically to the model. And because I have a second view bound to the same model, these changes will go back to the second view where it will be reflected automatically.</li>
                                 <li>It can get more advanced if you start dealing with Arrays and Collections </li>

                            Let's say I have an array of 3 superheroes and I bind it to a template using a repeating construct. What I'm telling the templating engine to do is to iterate through all the elements of the array, tie each element to the template. What you get out of this is this generated view of 3 super herores. And its not a one time thing. Lets say you push a new object into this array or you remove an object from the array or simply modify the contents of the array, the changes will be automatically reflected in the view. You don't have to do anything to manage the view once the two-way data binding is enabled.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            With data binding you can remove a lot of javascript code from your application. Because when you look at a typical application, about 70 to 80% of all the js is synchronizing the model with the view and updating the model with the changes in the view. All of this code can go away. So Angular teaches browser how to do data binding using existing api's. Google is actually creating a specification to propose this two way data binding feature to be built into next generation web browsers.

                            HTML can be very verbose sometimes. Let's take a simple example. Let's say that I would like to create a neat tab system in my application with Bootstrap CSS. In order to generate a simple component like this, I need to copy paste this chunk of html to get this view. This is not ideal. HTML has a limited set of vocabulary and often comes short when we want to build some basic components like Accordions or tabs natively. Also this is not maintainable. You have to copy/paste it again, change the div ids etc. If the template changes you need to go to all the places where it is used and change it.

                            So what I want in my html template is to specify a custom tag say "tab" and just tell the browser to render tabs. I want this page to have two tabs and each tab will have a title. You figure out what the underlying DOM structure needs to be generated. This is something that is supported by angular. This concept of reusable code is called Directives.

                            And its not just tabs. Think about all these components that you could build using this feature. You can also share it within/outside of your project. These components can be stateless or stateful.

                            So reusable components feature in Angular is built with existing JS & DOM APIs. It's available in all the browsers. And it is also being proposed to become native for all modern browsers. It's already been implemented in Chrome Dev versions.
