BillRive

BillRive is an Open Source Java based bill splitting application. This project is meant to be a learning platform for improving Software Engineering skills by testing various ideas around it.
This project can be used as a test bed to help fill the knowledge gaps of folks who are either new to Enterprise Web Development, have been working in the Software Engineering field but have some knowledge gaps, or those who are new to the scene and want to explore and learn using this project as a guide.

It could be that you want to learn about ORM paradigm (JPA/Hibernate) or Dependency Injection (Spring), or understand RESTful Web Services, or simply understand how a modern Web framework like Angular JS works.
This project helps you achieve those goals while working in a Community environment where the only goal is share what you learn with the others and learn what you can from others.

The members of this project meet once a week to discuss their  progress, challenges and what they would like to work on for the following week to continue their journey of learning.

BillRive comprises of two sub projects. 
The service is client agnostic and can serve any Web, Mobile and other applications. It is built around the principles of REST architecture using Spring Boot.

The client application is a modern Web Application which is designed using the MVC pattern, Dependency Injection 

billrive-service(Spring Boot, MVC, REST, JPA (Hibernate as provider), MySQL DB)
billrive-client (Angular JS, Bootstrap, Underscore)


Both the applications are currently bundled into one application titled "billrive-app"
